The installation is now complete and the disk image can be safely
unmounted. Compass can be launched from the Applications directory.

Installing on Windows
---------------------

The Compass setup application is downloaded as a .exe executable file.
Run the program to begin the setup process, which will automatically
install Compass.

Compass requires the **Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5 or later**.
If it is not already installed on the system, the setup program will
prompt to automatically install .NET.
