Installing on Windows

Connect Compass to MongoDB
--------------------------

.. steps::

   steps:
     - title: Run and connect to mongod
       body: |
         Once Compass is running, an initial connection dialog appears:

         .. figure:: /images/compass/connect-to-host.png
           :figwidth: 626px

         The information requested is as follows:

         ``Hostname:`` The hostname of the machine where ``mongod`` is
         running.

         ``Port:`` The port on which ``mongod`` is running.

         ``Authentication:`` Select an authentication mechanism to connect
         to the target host.

         Supported auth mechanisms:

         - MongoDB-CR
         - SCRAM-SHA-1
         - Kerberos
         - LDAP

         ``SSL:`` Select whether Compass should connect to the target host
         via SSL or not.

         ``SSH tunnel:`` Select whether Compass should connect to a MongoDB
         cluster via SSH tunnel. If selected, choose either a password or
         an identity file to provide authentication.

         ``Favorite Name (Optional):`` A name for the
         connection. (When you use Compass in the future,
         previous connections appear in the left pane of this window
         under Favorites).

         .. figure:: /images/compass/favorite-connections.png

         The above example shows a dialog window for a connection to
         a MongoDB server with authentication enabled.

         When the connection information is complete, click
         the Connect button to launch the main Compass window.

         .. figure:: /images/compass/select-collection.png

     - title: Select a collection
       body: |
         Use the left pane to select a collection to examine.

         .. figure:: /images/compass/select-database.png

         After you select a collection, Compass begins
         analysis and shows the results.
         Note that the example below is specific to the selected collection.

         .. figure:: /images/compass/sample-results.png

         .. note::
           If the initial document analysis is slow, Compass
           will prompt you within 30 seconds and ask if you want
           to continue or quit.
